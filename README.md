# coinFlipExperiment

This is a simple experiment designed for project one of my Applied Statistics course, Fall 2017.

The experiment itself is observing the flip of a fair coin 20 times, counting the number of heads. We will sample this experiment 5 times (once per group member) and then compare our results to the expected value and measure variability in our experiment.
